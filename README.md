# 🐄 FarmVet Connect

**Remote Livestock Health Management & Veterinary Consultation Platform**

FarmVet Connect is a full-stack web application that enables remote farms to submit animal health reports and receive veterinary consultation without requiring an on-site visit. Farm managers report sick animals through structured symptom questionnaires or free-text descriptions, and veterinarians review cases and send back treatment plans — all through a secure, role-based web portal.
